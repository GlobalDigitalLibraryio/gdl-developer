# GDL design
The GDL is in many ways created by re-using design, icons and code from other projects.

Most of your design components are from [Material Design](https://material.io). Material Design is a design system – backed by open-source code – that helps teams build digital experiences.

For easy code implementation, we use React components that implement Google's Material Design from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

We also use Material Design icons. Material icons are delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common actions and items. The GDL team have used Material Icons throughout the front end design. The only exception is the social media icons where we use elements from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

The icons we use from Font Awesome are released under the CC BY 4.0 license.

The icons and resources from Material Design are released under the Apache License 2.0.

Soon we will release our Sketch design files on GitHub.
