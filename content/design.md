# GDL design

By designing with the users, and not for them, our team aim to build the GDL to address better the specific context, culture, behaviours and expectations of the people who will directly interact with the GDL platform. Designing together means partnering with users throughout the project lifecycle, co-creating solutions, and continuously gathering and incorporating users’ feedback.

The GDL is in many ways built with design, icons and code from other projects.

Most of our design components are from [Material Design](https://material.io). Material Design is a design system – backed by open-source code – that helps teams build digital experiences.

For easy code implementation, we use React components that implement Google's Material Design from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

We also use Material Design icons, which are delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common actions and items. The GDL team have used Material Design Icons throughout the application. The only exception is the social media icons where we use elements from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

Licensing:
* The icons we use from Font Awesome are released under the CC BY 4.0 license.
* The icons and resources from Material Design are released under the Apache License 2.0.

Soon we will release the GDL Sketch design files on GitHub.
