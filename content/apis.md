# The GDL Open APIs

The GDL platform provides a set of APIs, allowing for individual programmers, projects and organizations to build new apps and service with content from the Global Digital Library. We currently provide APIs for images, books and games. Each API listing offers documentation on the usage of the API plus the specification of operations.

All APIs are open and available for anyone to use. 
We have enable rate limiting on all our APIs. If you intend to use any of our APIs permanently, please [contact us](mailto:support@digitallibrary.io).
Our APIs generally respond with JSON.
