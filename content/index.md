# Enabling the GDL developer community  

The developer portal is an essential part of the GDL project. Our goal is to enable developer communities, designers and content providers to reuse software, content and design elements from the GDL in new projects.\
By taking this open approach to digital development, we hope to help increase collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplication of work.

## APIs

The GDL platform provides a set of APIs, allowing for individual programmers, projects and organizations to build new apps and service with content from the Global Digital Library. We currently provide APIs for pictures and books. Each API listing offers documentation on the usage of the API plus the specification of operations.

## Feeds

An OPDS catalogue enables the aggregation, distribution, and discovery of books, journals, and other digital content by any user, from any source, in an electronic format, on any device. The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog specification is a syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom (RFC4287) and HTTP (RFC2616). The GDL provides an OPDS catalogue with access to all books in all current languages.

The GDL will collect existing high quality open educational reading resources, and make them available on the web, mobile and for print. If your organization is developing reading resources in your project you can contribute by committing your content to the GDL.
