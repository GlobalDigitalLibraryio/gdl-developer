## Enabling the GDL developer community
The developer portal is an important part of the GDL initiative, launched to enable different developer communities, designers and translators that would like to re-use content, software or design from the GDL.

By taking this open approach to digital development we hope to help increase collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplicating work that has already been done.
